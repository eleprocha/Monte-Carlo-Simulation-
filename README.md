#Estimate a propability
In this code we will focus in the estimation of a propability  by providing a specific  example in order to figure out how MC method helps investigate a propability after many random trials.We  need to compute a simple unbiased die propability problem.The question is how to compute the propability of rolling a die six times and getting a different face with each roll?
